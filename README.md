# Gravity/Methoda - Bomb exercise
This is the implementation of the bomb exercise made by Yossi Rosilio for Gravity and Methoda.

## Exercise goals
The exercise goals are:
- Practice the protocols UART, I2C and SPI
- Practice using a logic analyzer for decoding a protocol

Its secondary goals are:
- "Sell" digital protocols to the students in a fun way
- Improve team dynamics for the students

## Exercise dependencies
The exercise runs in the protocols unit, after the lecture.

## Running the exercise
1. After consulting with the staff, divide the class into groups of 1-3. The group size is based on how you think would be the best to run the exercise, considering the students' level, team dynamics, and available setups.
2. Build one setup for each group. Detailed explanation is in a separate section.
3. Connect the setup (Arduino UNO + Logic Analyzer) to the working station of the group. Make sure the hostname of that PC is documented for you.
4. From the teachers' PC, use `psexec` to run the bomb client web interface. Detailed explanation on how to run the web interface is in a separate section.
5. From the web interface, set the correct left time on the bomb (derived from the time allocated for the exercise), and the current level and level queue.

At that point the exercise should be running, waiting for the students to solve it. At the end of this document you can find tips for how to solve problems that can occure while running the exercise.
